                            <h6>Our story began in the field quite literally. Back in the days when our co-founder Ankit was leading animal health projects, one thing became crystal clear: too many systems were driven by money, overloaded with complexity, and lacked real user integration. More work. More confusion. Less clarity.</h6>
                            <h6>So, we asked ourselves : what if we flipped the script? <br /> What if we created something smarter, friendlier, and actually built around the people who use it?</h6>
                            <h6>Yosemite Crew was born from that idea. A digital space where simplicity meets interactivity, where products are easy to use, easy to recognize, and most importantly easy to love. We&apos;ve spent our time deeply understanding user problems so we can solve them, not add to them.</h6>
                            <h6>Why We&apos;re Different <br /> Sure, we’re open source but we’re not just another codebase floating on GitHub.</h6>
