## Key Findings

### The Biggest Duplication Hotspots

1. **AddTaskScreen vs EditTaskScreen** (330 lines duplicated)
   - Location: `/screens/tasks/{Add,Edit}TaskScreen/`
   - Impact: 75% of both files are similar
   - Solution: useFormScreenBase hook

2. **Form Sections** (250+ lines)
   - Location: 6 task form components
   - Impact: 100% identical structure
   - Solution: Component factory pattern

3. **Styling** (150+ lines across 20+ files)
   - Location: Every form component defines its own styles
   - Impact: Impossible to update styles globally
   - Solution: Shared style utility factory

4. **TaskCard vs ExpenseCard** (100+ lines)
   - Location: Card component implementations
   - Impact: Same action button logic in both
   - Solution: Extract SwipeableCardRenderer

5. **Form State Hooks** (50+ lines)
   - Location: useTaskFormState vs useExpenseForm
   - Impact: Same patterns, different naming
   - Solution: Generic useFormState hook

## How Duplication Was Measured

**Definition Used:** Lines of code that are functionally identical or nearly identical (95%+ similar) across different files.

**Methodology:**
1. File-by-file comparison of AddTaskScreen vs EditTaskScreen
2. Component structure comparison across 6 form sections
3. Style definition inventory across all files
4. Hook implementation comparison
5. Visual pattern matching for layout duplication

**Exclusions:**
- Variable names that differ (counted as same if logic identical)
- Comment variations
- Import statement differences
- Single-line functional differences that don't affect behavior

---

## No Breaking Changes Guaranteed

All consolidation recommendations can be implemented as:
- New shared components/utilities (additive)
- Gradual migration of existing components
- Backward compatibility through wrappers
- Phase-by-phase rollout without downtime

**Zero API changes required** - existing code continues to work.

## Quick Start: Quick Wins (2-3 hours)

If you only have time for quick wins:

1. **Extract Icon Styles** (30 min) - Save 20 lines
   - Create `/utils/formStyles.ts`
   - Add dropdownIcon, calendarIcon utilities
   - Update 8 files to import

2. **Extract Field Spacing** (20 min) - Save 10 lines
   - Add fieldGroup utility to formStyles.ts
   - Update 10 files to import

3. **Update TaskCard** (1 hour) - Save 50 lines
   - Import createCardStyles from cardStyles.ts
   - Use helper functions for action buttons
   - Remove 50+ lines of local style definitions

**Total Result:** 80 lines saved in 1.5-2 hours with LOW risk

## Questions Answered by Docs

**Q: How much duplication is there?**
A: 800+ lines total, concentrated in 5 areas (see DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md)

**Q: Which files are affected?**

A: 12-18 hours for full consolidation, can be done in phases (see QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

**Q: What's the biggest duplication?**
A: AddTaskScreen and EditTaskScreen are 70-75% identical (see DUPLICATION_DETAILS.md)

**Q: What's the safest first step?**
A: Extract styles - low risk, visible impact (see QUICK_REFERENCE.md "Quick Wins")

**Q: Which forms are duplicated?**
A: 6 form sections have 100% identical structure (see DUPLICATION_DETAILS.md "Form Sections")
